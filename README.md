I'm a passionate self-learner with a growing interest in all things computer-related.  I started learning programming in mid-2023 – and I’ve been hooked ever since!
My journey into programming began with **C#**, and I've also taken my first steps into **JavaScript** and **C++**.

Skills: C# / C++ / JS
